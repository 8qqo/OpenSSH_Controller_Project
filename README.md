# OpenSSH Controller for Windows (Dev-C++ Edition)

## ✨ Overview

This repository hosts a lightweight, secure, and Windows-native OpenSSH controller application developed using **Dev-C++**, following **Microsoft's Windows Development Guidelines**. The project aims to bridge the usability of SSH on Windows systems while retaining full control over the source and build process.

This controller supports launching OpenSSH sessions via native Windows APIs, manages basic SSH connection parameters, integrates a minimal resource UI (via `.rc` scripts), and ensures compatibility with Windows 10, 11, and Server editions. While not a full SSH stack reimplementation, it offers a modular controller for OpenSSH invocation and configuration.

## ⚙️ Build Instructions

### ✅ Requirements

* Windows 10, 11, or Server 2019+
* [Dev-C++ 5.11](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) with TDM-GCC compiler
* Optional: [OpenSSL for Windows](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) if encryption libraries are needed
* Windows SDK preinstalled (for headers like `winsock2.h` and `wincrypt.h`)

### 🧱 Compilation Steps

1. Launch Dev-C++ and open `OpenSSH.dev`
2. Navigate to **Project > Project Options > Parameters**
3. Add required linker flags:

   ```bash
   -lws2_32 -mwindows
   ```

   *(Append `-lssl -lcrypto` for OpenSSL integration)*
4. Click **F11** to build and execute

### 🔍 Notes

* Ensure `myicon.ico` is available during compilation
* Resource scripts must be compiled before linking if modified
* Always run Dev-C++ as Administrator when working in `Program Files`

## 🛡 Microsoft Windows Compliance

This project was designed with full compliance to Microsoft Windows guidelines for native applications:

| Compliance Category  | Details                                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ File Paths         | Unicode-compliant paths, support for `%APPDATA%`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%`    |
| ✅ Registry Access    | Optional configuration keys can be stored in `HKCU\Software\OpenSSH`  |
| ✅ Windows API        | Uses `WinSock2`, `Crypt32`, `ShellExecuteW`, `GetUserNameW`           |
| ✅ Resource Usage     | Implements `.rc` for icons, versioning, manifest (UAC ready)          |
| ✅ Privilege Handling | Supports user-mode execution and optional elevation via UAC prompt    |
| ✅ Console Support    | UTF-8 compliant console output, `SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8)` applied |

## 📚 Developer Notes

### Header Highlights (`OpenSSH_private.h`):

* Macro definitions for buffer sizes
* Path constants for SSH binary
* Command templates for automatic host connection

### Icon/Resource Usage

* Project embeds icons and version metadata through `resource.rc`
* Can be extended to support multilingual `StringTable`

### Potential Additions

* PowerShell integration layer
* WinForms-based GUI wrapper
* Background process service registration (via Windows Task Scheduler or SCM)
